\section{Overview}
Basic blanked out version of UTC working template. This is not error free, and not guaranteed to fully work. Tweaking of margins, title spacing may be necessary to fully pass the review process, but this should get you most of the way there. Use this with the knowledge that you'll have to do some debugging \cite{utclatex}.

You will need to tweak both the \lstinline{utc_thesis.tex} and the \lstinline{utthesis.cls} files for formatting the pages, notably for the headers, etc.

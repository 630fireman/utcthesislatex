# UTC Thesis LaTeX Template.
Template for UTC (University of Tennessee at Chattanooga) Master's theses using LaTeX

Basic blanked out version of UTC working template. This is not error free, and not guaranteed to fully work. Tweaking of margins, title spacing may be necessary to fully pass the review process, but this should get you most of the way there. I had to use Adobe Acrobat for fine adjustment of some titles, etc.

See [the example PDF](utc_thesis.pdf) to preview the basic structure of the template.

Use this with the knowledge that you'll have to do some debugging.

See [the UTC Thesis website](https://new.utc.edu/research/graduate-school/student-resources/thesis-and-dissertation) to reference the standards for formatting.
